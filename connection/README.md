Connection Matrix
=================

The vector matrix is generated using a python script.
The four basic tile elements found in the elements/ folder are then copied
together into the matrix/ folder in .svg format, which is then converted into
.dxf using inkskape and pstoedit.
It is then embroidered onto a patch of textile and used to connect the
Luminet2 pixels.

The pdf/ folder contains the three iterations of the connection design.

The generate.py script uses [pycairo][], [inkskape][] and [pstoedit][].

[pycairo]: http://cairographics.org/pycairo/
[inkskape]: http://inkscape.org
[pstoedit]: http://www.pstoedit.net
